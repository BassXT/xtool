# XTool Home Assistant Integration

This is a **custom integration for Home Assistant** that connects and monitors **xTool laser engravers** such as **P2**, **F1**, **M1**, and **Apparel**.

> ⚠️ This integration is an independent community project.  
> I am **not affiliated with xTool** or its employees — but I’d love to collaborate with the xTool team for further testing 😉.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Native Home Assistant integration** (no YAML required)
- **Multiple devices supported** — each xTool appears as its own device
- **Automatic entity creation** per device:
  - `binary_sensor.<name>_<device_type>_power` → shows if the machine is reachable/on
  - `sensor.<name>_<device_type>_status` → shows the current working state
  - **M1** adds extra sensors:
    - `sensor.<name>_m1_cpu_temp`
    - `sensor.<name>_m1_water_temp`
    - `sensor.<name>_m1_purifier`
- Typical status values: `Running`, `Done`, `Idle`, `Sleep`, `Ready`, `Unavailable`, `Unknown`

## 🧩 Installation

### via HACS (recommended)
1. Add this repository as a **Custom Repository** in HACS.  
2. Search for **“XTool”** and install.  
3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Copy the folder `xtool` into your `config/custom_components/` directory.  
3. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (UI)

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.  
2. Search for **“XTool”**.  
3. Enter:
   - **Name** → freely chosen (e.g. `Laser1`)
   - **IP Address** → IP of your xTool device
   - **Device Type** → choose between `P2`, `F1`, `M1`, or `Apparel`
4. Confirm — done ✅  

Each device automatically creates the appropriate entities in Home Assistant based on its **`name`** and **`device_type`**.

## 🆔 Entity Naming

Entity IDs are automatically generated using the **Name** and **Device Type** you provide during setup:

| Example | Entities Created |
|----------|------------------|
| Name: `Laser1`, Type: `F1` | `binary_sensor.laser1_f1_power`<br>`sensor.laser1_f1_status` |
| Name: `Laser2`, Type: `P2` | `binary_sensor.laser2_p2_power`<br>`sensor.laser2_p2_status` |
| Name: `Studio`, Type: `M1` | `sensor.studio_m1_status`<br>`sensor.studio_m1_cpu_temp`<br>`sensor.studio_m1_water_temp`<br>`sensor.studio_m1_purifier` |
| Name: `Laser3`, Type: `S1` | `binary_sensor.laser3_s1_power`<br>`binary_sensor.laser3_s1_running`<br>`binary_sensor.laser3_s1_alarm`<br>`sensor.laser3_s1_status`<br>`sensor.laser3_s1_firmware_version`<br>`sensor.laser3_s1_job_file`<br>`sensor.laser3_s1_position_x`<br>`sensor.laser3_s1_position_y`<br>`sensor.laser3_s1_fan_a`<br>`sensor.laser3_s1_fan_b` |

**S1 with AP2 Air Cleaner** adds these additional entities (using the same name prefix):

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `binary_sensor.laser3_s1_air_cleaner` | Air cleaner running state |
| `sensor.laser3_s1_air_cleaner_model` | Air cleaner model |
| `sensor.laser3_s1_air_cleaner_speed` | Fan speed |
| `sensor.laser3_s1_air_cleaner_sensor_d` | Particle sensor D reading |
| `sensor.laser3_s1_air_cleaner_sensor_s` | Particle sensor S reading |
| `sensor.laser3_s1_pre_filter_remaining` | Pre-filter life remaining (%) |
| `sensor.laser3_s1_medium_efficiency_filter_remaining` | Medium efficiency filter life remaining (%) |
| `sensor.laser3_s1_activated_carbon_filter_remaining` | Activated carbon filter life remaining (%) |
| `sensor.laser3_s1_ultra_dense_carbon_mesh_filter_remaining` | Ultra dense carbon mesh filter life remaining (%) |
| `sensor.laser3_s1_high_efficiency_filter_remaining` | High efficiency filter life remaining (%) |
